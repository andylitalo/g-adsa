epsn_233-0~sigma_3-01: uses epsilon = 233.0 and sigma = 3.01 for 1k3f polyol (N = 41, Mw = 1000 g/mol). The entries for the interfacial tension at 30 MPa and 40 MPa were negative, so they were changed to the value for 20 MPa, 0.065 mN/m. This is low enough that it likely will not affect calculations significantly. The diffusivities are also interpolated by hand using 1k3f_30c.csv data. I didn't see a large effect of temperature on the diffusivity between 1k3f_30c.csv and 1k3f_60c.csv, so I think this is a reasonable estimate.
