# input

Contains input data for analysis.

## Folders

- `adsa`: contains data from axisymmetric drop-shape analysis (pendant drop)
These data are measurements of the interfacial tension and volume of bubbles
based on images of a pendant drop.
- `datathief`: contains results from using "Datathief", a program that turns
traces of visual plots into data tables, which was necessary when the
Belsorp software refused to print out the data table after the pressure
transducers broke; only the plotted results were available
- `dft_pred`: predictions of interfacial tension and other thermophysical
properties of polyol-carbon dioxide mixtures from a density functional theory
model developed by Dr. Huikuan Chao in the Wang group
- `eos`: contains equation of state data for carbon dioxide at different
temperatures
- `gravimetry`: contains data from highly sensitive gravimetry measurements
performed with a Rubotherm on a small bolus of polyol
