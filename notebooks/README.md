# notebooks

Contains notebooks for combining measurements using gravimetry and axisymmetric
drop-shape analysis (see `input` folder for data) and estimating the density,
solubility, interfacial tension, and diffusivity of polyol-CO2 mixtures at
different pressures and temperatures.
Contains additional analysis for comparison with literature data as well.

## Guide to notebooks

- `<yyyymmdd>_<MMDD>_<n>k<f>f_<T>c_analysis.ipynb`: analysis to compute
density, solubility, interfacial tension, and diffusivity at different pressures
for mixtures of carbon dioxide and a polyol of molecular weight `<n>` kg/mol
with a functionality of `<f>` at temperature `<T>` degrees Celsius performed in
the year `<yyyy>` from the `<dd>` day of the `<mm>` month to the `<DD>` day of
the `<MM>` month.
