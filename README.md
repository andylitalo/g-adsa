# g-adsa

Version: `0.0.1`

Code for computing gas solubility, gas diffusivity, specific volume, and
interfacial tension of polyol-CO2 mixtures measured with
gravimetry-axisymmetric drop-shape analysis (G-ADSA) in the Di Maio Lab of the
University of Naples by Andy Ylitalo during the summer of 2019.

To use, install Python 3 (tested with v`3.6.X`) and Jupyter Notebook, install
required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, download the repo,
and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to compute the 
desired properties and make plots thereof.

## Folder Structure
